    "API rate limit optimization: You can better manage API rate limits by controlling the concurrency level of requests, potentially avoiding throttling while maximizing throughput.\n",

For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation.

    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
