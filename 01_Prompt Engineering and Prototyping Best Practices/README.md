### Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE6 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/Beyond-ChatGPT)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application. 

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE6/tree/main/00_Setting%20Up%20Git)!

#### How AIM Does Assignments
Throughout our time together - we'll be providing a number of assignments. Each assignment can be split into two broad categories:

- Base Assignment - a more conceptual and theory based assignment focused on locking in specific key concepts and learnings.
- Hardmode Assignment - a more programming focused assignment focused on core code-concepts.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓Questions - these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!
- 🏗️ Activities - these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.
- 🚧 Advanced Builds - these will only appear in Hardmode assignments, and will require you to build something with little to no help outside of documentation!

##### 🏗️ Activity #1:

Evaluation on my system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner. 
    Aspect Tested:
    -  Simplicity: ✓ Clear and free of jargon; beginner-friendly language.
    -  Concrete Examples: ✓ The car example effectively illustrates objects with properties and behaviors.
    -  Core Concepts: ✱ Partial – Covers objects and briefly mentions classes as blueprints, but omits key principles like inheritance and encapsulation.
    -  Beginner-Friendliness: ✓ Very accessible for someone with no programming background.
    -  Practical Relevance: ✓ Explains real-world benefits like reusability and modularity.
    -  Logical Flow: ✓ Well-structured, moving from definition to example to benefits.
    -  Completeness: ✱ Partial – Introduces object basics well, but lacks mention of all core OOP principles.
    -  Accuracy: ✓ Technically correct throughout.

Overall, the response is quite good for a beginner explanation, particularly with its simplicity and relatable example.

2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points… (I attached a technical paper)
    Aspect Tested:
    - Accuracy: ✓ Yes - The summary accurately captures the key components and workings of the Transformer model described in the original text.
    - Completeness: ✓ Yes - The summary includes all major elements.
    - Conciseness: Questionable - A good summary should typically condense information more.
    - Clarity: ✓ Yes - The summary presents information in a logical order and maintains clear connections between concepts.
    - Preservation of technical accuracy: ✓ Yes - Technical terms are correctly used and relationships between components are accurately described.
    - Language: ✓ Yes - The summary uses appropriate language for describing technical concepts in the field of machine learning.

If this was meant to be a summary, it maintains technical accuracy and completeness, but could be more concise. It reads more like a restatement of the original paragraph rather than a significantly condensed summary

3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    Aspect Tested:
    - Accuracy: ✓ Correctly captures key components and mechanics of the Transformer model.
    - Completeness: ✓ Covers all major points from the original text.
    - Conciseness: ✱ Needs improvement – The summary is closer to a restatement than a true condensation.
    - Clarity: ✓ Logically organized and easy to follow.
    - Technical Precision: ✓ Uses appropriate terminology and accurately describes relationships between components.
    - Language: ✓ Appropriate for a machine learning context.

Overall, the summary is accurate and thorough but should be more concise to better fit the purpose of summarization.

4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
   Aspect Tested:
    - Mathematical Accuracy: ✓ Correct calculations for both apples (12 ÷ 4 = 3) and oranges (9 ÷ 3 = 3).
    - Step-by-Step Explanation: ✓ Clearly walks through the logic, addressing apples and oranges in order.
    - Clarity: ✓ Easy to follow, with well-structured reasoning.
    - Completeness: ✓ Fully answers the question with the correct number of packs.
    - Logical Flow: ✓ Moves naturally from problem statement to solution.
    - Relevance: ✓ Focuses directly on the question without unnecessary detail.
    - Tone: ✓ Friendly and approachable, with clear communication.
    - Conciseness: ✓ Thorough but efficient in explanation.

Overall, an excellent response—accurate, well-explained, and easy to understand, especially for someone less comfortable with math.

5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone…
   Aspect Tested:
    - Content Preservation: ✓ All key story elements (robot, city, garden, squirrel, friendship) are retained.
    - Tone Transformation: ✓ Effectively shifts from a fairy tale style to a formal, professional tone.
    - Vocabulary Elevation: ✓ Casual words are thoughtfully replaced with more sophisticated alternatives (e.g., robot → automaton, wandering → traversing).
    - Sentence Structure: ✓ Simple constructions are rephrased into more complex, formal sentences without losing meaning.
    - Formality Markers: ✓ Uses elevated transitions and refined expressions (e.g., “Henceforth,” “in unison”).
    - Register Consistency: ✓ Maintains a formal register throughout the text.
    - Narrative Flow: ✓ The sequence and emotional arc of the story remain intact.
    - Emotional Essence: ✓ Despite the formal tone, the warmth and connection of the original are preserved.

Overall, the rewrite skillfully meets the transformation goal, maintaining narrative integrity while elevating tone, structure, and language.

This "vibe check" now serves as a baseline, of sorts, to help understand what holes your application has.

##### 🚧 Advanced Build:

Please make adjustments to your application that you believe will improve the vibe check done above, push the changes to your HF Space and redo the above vibe check.

> NOTE: You may reach for improving the model, changing the prompt, or any other method.
>
> For Q1 and Q3, I updated the system prompt to address weak performance aspects: improving core concepts and completeness in explanation tasks, and enhancing conciseness in summarization tasks

The update system prompt is:

system_template = """You are a helpful assistant who always speaks in a pleasant tone!

Note if you are tasked to do a summary, summarize each paragraph in 2–3 sentences, focusing only on the core ideas. 
Avoid restating the full content—compress it meaningfully. 

Also if you are tasked to provide a clear and complete explanation, make sure to cover all essential concepts or components related to the topic. 
If the concept includes key principles, categories, or steps, include each one with a brief explanation. 
Use examples if they help clarify the idea.

"""


Evaluation on Q1. response with updated prompt:
-----------------------------------------------

Core concepts coverage: ✓ Yes - Significantly improved from the previous version. Now thoroughly covers all four major OOP principles (objects, classes, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism).
Completeness: ✓ Yes - Covers all essential OOP concepts with explanations and examples for each.


Evaluation on Q2. response with updated prompt:
-----------------------------------------------

Conciseness: ✓ Yes - This version is significantly more concise than the previous response, condensing the information into a single paragraph.

Evaluation on Q3. response with updated prompt:
----------------------------------------------

Conciseness: Partially - While the story itself is concise, the addition of a summary afterward is unnecessary and reduces overall conciseness. The summary essentially repeats what was already communicated in the story.

### A Note on Vibe Checking

"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.

In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

##### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑❓ Discussion Question #1:

What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?
To my understanding, even if this vibe check (baseline evaluation) serves as a starting point, there’s an inherent limitation in its generalizability. updating prompt did not imporove conciseness for the summary section of the story. Evaluation metrics like clarity, tone, and completeness are often subjective and context-dependent, which means the criteria—and even the standards for what counts as "good"—can shift significantly depending on the type of task, target audience, or domain (e.g., technical, creative, educational).

Additionally:

The metric interpretations may vary with different types of content (e.g., summarizing legal text vs. rewriting a story).

There's often no universal ground truth—especially in open-ended tasks like tone shifts or simplification.

The evaluator’s perspective or expectations (e.g., expert vs. layperson) can subtly influence scoring.

Metrics like “emotional essence” or “narrative flow” are qualitative, and while we can assess them heuristically, they’re not fixed or perfectly repeatable across examples.
